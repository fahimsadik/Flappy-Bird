## Flappy Bird

The game is a side-scrolling arcade experience where the player controls a bird. The objective is to fly the bird through a series of pipes without hitting them or the ground. A single tap or button press makes the bird flap its wings, giving it a small upward thrust, while gravity continuously pulls it down.

# The game features:

- 🏁 Start screen with a **3-2-1 countdown**
- 🐥 Tap/click/space to make the bird flap
- 📱 Touch input support (for mobile builds)
- ⌨️ Keyboard support (`Space` or mouse click)
- 🎵 Sound effects: flap, start, coin, death
- 🧠 Score system with final score display
- 💀 Game Over screen with dead bird sprite
- 🔁 Restartable via Game Over UI
- 🧩 Modular code (GameManager, Logic, Bird)

Simple, Addictive Mechanics: The core gameplay loop of flapping to avoid obstacles is easy to learn but difficult to master.

Procedurally Generated Pipes: The pipes are created randomly, ensuring a new and challenging experience with each playthrough.

Collision Detection: The game accurately detects collisions between the bird and the pipes or the ground, ending the game on impact.

Scoring System: A score is awarded for each pair of pipes the bird successfully navigates through.
